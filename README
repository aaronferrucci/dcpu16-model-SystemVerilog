Behavioral model of DCPU-16 processor.  A verification testbench component.  
This component will be handy for testing hardware implementations of the 
processor.

Processor spec: http://0x10c.com/doc/dcpu-16.txt

Simulation:
My goal is to support DCPU-16 RTL development using free tools, and with the 
minimum possible involvement of software licensing. I'm simulating with
Modelsim Altera Starter Edition 6.6d; the Makefile is full of assumptions 
about that particular simulator; I don't intend that the model and the 
simulation test program (test_program.sv) have any such assumptions, but 
until I test with a different simulator, there probably are some.

How-To:
After cloning, open a shell in the test subdirectory and type 

  % make

This will compile everything and simulate with the default target test 
program.  To use a different target test program, do

  % make TEST=other.hex

Dependencies:
My goal is to verify the model against a C DCPU-16 emulator
(aaronferrucci/dcpu16, forked from swetland/dcpu16).  To compile test program
hex files, use a16 in that project.  Soon I plan to run both the C emulator
and the model against the same hex file, and diff the outputs to determine 
pass/fail.
